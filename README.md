## GIPEDI Weekly Meet 6
#### June 18, 2021
Prof Subrat Kar explained the importance of requirement sheet and specification sheet before commencing work on a project. I helps to identify the objectives, estimate the duration and cost of the project. It further helps in laying the road-map for the complete compilation of the project. 

## GIPEDI One-to-one Interaction with Prof Samaresh Das
#### June 21, 2021
Prof Das asked me to share a presentation on the design and simulation progress on metamaterial for W-Band, and continue to find ways to optimize the design. I also informed him that the HFSS software is taking more than 90 mins for each simulation in the 70 - 100 GHz frequency range. 

## Metamaterial Project Progress
Refering to [1]–[3], I designed the following:

After adding the substrate (ROGERS RT 5880), the absorption bands become more well-defined.

In order to have enhanced absorption bands, I replaced the U-slot with Concentric square ring-slots, in the presence of Rogers RT 5880 substrate with dielectric constant value 2.2.

<img width="465" alt="Screenshot8" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78949263/123249246-63740500-d506-11eb-9ab6-c254f425e79f.png">
<img width="469" alt="Screenshot9" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78949263/123249268-6838b900-d506-11eb-808d-6b876269671b.png">

As a result, the absorption bands got enhanced and the resonant frequencies shifted slightly towards lower frequencies.

### Plan for next week
- Vary slot dimensions to study its effect on absorbance
- Vary the dimensions of vias in the mushroom ground to study its effect on absorbance
- Use spiral resonator in place of concentric ring resonator to get broader absorption band since the former offers higher electrical length [4].
  
### Growth of my Coriander plant

 Small Coriander leaves have started to grow.
